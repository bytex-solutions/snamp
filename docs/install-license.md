Installing license
====
This article will be helpful only if you have a paid subscription and installed SNAMP Management Console.

##Installation

## Subscription policy
There are two points of licensing:
1. **Which Resource Adapters** you want to use
1. **How many resources** you want to connect to SNAMP

What is not limited by our subscription policy:
1. How many instances of the same resource adapter you want to use
1. How many SNAMP instances you want to deploy into the cluster

## Limitations
There is no functional limitations if you exceed a limits described in the license file. You just see alerts in your SNAMP Management Console. But you should take into account the one important thing: **any incident occurred in period of limits excess are not covered by the SLA agreement**.
