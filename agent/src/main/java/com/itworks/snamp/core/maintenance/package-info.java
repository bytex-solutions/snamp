/**
 * Maintainable Objects Framework that ables humans to communicate with objects at runtime.
 * <p>
 *     Maintainable object means that the human may send command with arguments to the object
 *     (such as SNAMP plugin) at runtime using plain textual convention. This way of communication
 *     is similar to shell where user can print some command such as ls, cat and etc.
