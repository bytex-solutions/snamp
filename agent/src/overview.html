    atomic management entities (called attributes) into the SNAMP platform. This component is a back-end
    of the SNAMP platform.</li>
    <li>Adapter - provides conversion of the management information supplied by connector into the new
    representation and exposes this information to the world This component is a front-end of the
    SNAMP platform.</li>
    <li>Manager - provides SNAMP platform management interface for configuring SNAMP, such as Web console or
    command-line interface.</li>
    <li>(Agent) configuration - the configuration of the SNAMP platform that is used to instantiate
    connectors and adapter.</li>
    <li>Agent - the heart of the SNAMP platform that provides hosting of the connector, adapter and manager.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>{@link com.snamp.connectors} for management connectors.</li>
    <li>{@link com.snamp.adapters} for adapters.</li>
    <li>{@link com.snamp.hosting.management} for managers.</li>
