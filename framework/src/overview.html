SNAMP is a middleware solution for monitoring of the software components in your enterprise IT-infrastructure.
This solution is running on top of OSGi Framework and can be hosted in every OSGi R4.3-compliant containers,
such as Apache Felix, Knopflerfish, Eclipse Equinox.
It consists of the following parts (bundles):
<ul>
    <li>SNAMP Framework - reusable set of classes and interfaces used to write SNAMP components.</li>
    <li>Management connector - provides connection to the management information base and exposes
    atomic management entities (called attributes) through OSGi. This component is a back-end
    of the SNAMP solution.</li>
    <li>Adapter - provides conversion of the management information supplied by connector into the new
    representation and exposes this information to the outside world. This component is a front-end of the
    SNAMP solution.</li>
    <li>Manager - provides SNAMP management interface for configuring SNAMP, such as Web console or
    command-line interface.</li>
    <li>(Agent) configuration - the configuration of the SNAMP specific bundles used to instantiate
    connectors and adapters.</li>
</ul>
For each architectural component the SNAMP solution provides separated Java package:
<ul>
    <li>{@link com.itworks.snamp.connectors} for management connectors.</li>
    <li>{@link com.itworks.snamp.adapters} for adapters.</li>
    <li>{@link com.itworks.snamp.management} for managers.</li>
    <li>{@link com.itworks.snamp.configuration} for configuring SNAMP bundles.</li>
</ul>
